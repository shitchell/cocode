## Uses

* Useful for live previews of your HTML as you edit
* Realtime collaboration is useful for tutoring or otherwise helping someone with HTML.
* The mobile interface defaults to a fullscreen preview of the webpage, which (combined with the realtime collaboration aspect) means you can edit from your desktop and view the updates in realtime on your mobile device. This is incredibly handy to see immediately how changes will appear on mobile.
