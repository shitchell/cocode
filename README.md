For now, to create a new page, you'll have to edit the part after the `#` symbol. So if you want to create a new page, you would edit the url to look like `https://shitchell.github.io/cocode/#mypage` for example. On my todo list is adding an input box in the header where you can more easily just type in any name and hit enter.
